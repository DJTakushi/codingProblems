Find all subsets of a given set of integers
 - [1,2,3]
We are given a set of integers and we have to find all the possible subsets of this set of integers. The following example elaborates on this further
Given the set of integers:
 - [2,3,4]
All possile subsets for the given set of integers:
   - [],[2],[3],[2,3],[4],[2,4],[3,4],[2,3,4]
 - Runtime Complexity: Exponential, O(2^n*n)
 - Memory Complexity: Exponential, O(2^n*n)"
