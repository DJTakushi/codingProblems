Problem #14 [Medium] \
This problem was asked by Google. \
The area of a circle is defined as πr^2. Estimate π to 3 decimal places using a Monte Carlo method. \
Hint: The basic equation of a circle is x2 + y2 = r2.")

## Notes
- Area of circle is pi*r^2
- Area of square that circumscribes this is (r*2)^2=4r^2
- A_circle/A_square = (pi*r^2)/(4r^2)
- (A_circle/A_square)*4=pi
- In quadrant I of unit circle, y = sqrt(1-x^2)
