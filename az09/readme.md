## How many ways can you make change with coins and a total amount
Suppose we have coin denominations of [1, 2, 5] and the total amount is 7.  We can make changes in the following 6 ways:
 - Denominations: 1,2,5
 - Amount: 7
  - 1:  1,1,1,1,1,1,1
  - 2:  1,1,1,1,1,2
  - 3:  1,1,1,2,2
  - 4:  1,2,2,2
  - 5:  1,1,5
  - 6:  2,5
 - Total Methods: 6
Runtime Complexity: Quadratic, O(m*n)
Memory Complexity: Linear, O(n)")
