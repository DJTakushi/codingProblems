# Daily Coding Problem 3
Given two sorted linked lists, merge them so that the resulting linked list is also sorted. Consider two sorted linked lists and the merged list below them as an example.
 - head1->4->8->15->19->NULL
 - head2->7->9->10->16->NULL
 - head1->4->7->8->9->10->15->16->19->NULL
Linear, O(m + n)O(m+n) where m and n are lengths of both linked lists")
